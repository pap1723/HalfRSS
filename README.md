# HalfRSS
Half Sized RSS (5x Kerbin scale, 1/2 Real Solar System Scale)

Pap1723

Github: https://github.com/pap1723/HalfRSS

This mod will convert the Kerbol System into our Real Solar System, but at half of the actual size. This makes it 5 times larger than KSP stock sizes.

Includes code and artwork from RealSolarSystem by NathanKell

Includes artwork by dimonnomid and SpacedInvader and Dr. Walther and KillAshley in addition to NathanKell.

Includes biomes by Felger and grayduster and KellanHiggins and KillAshley.

Some planetary imagery is derived from work by Steve Albers and NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and some from the Celestia Motherlode (itself in the main sourced from JPL). Used by permission of the licenses for non-commercial release.

ALSO INCLUDED:
Module Manager (by sarbian, swamp_ig, and ialdabaoth). See thread for details, license, and source: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219
Kopernicus (by teknoman, bryce, Thomas P., and NathanKell). See thread for details, license, and source: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114649

SPECIAL THANKS:
*NathanKell and the entire RealSolarSystem group for creating almost everything that is released in this
*CaptRobau for letting me use Thatmo and Slate as two of the Dwarf Planets from his great Outer Planets Mod
*OhioBob for creating the great atmospheres
*Kopernicus Team for creating the mod that makes this all possible, Thomas P., NathanKell, KillAshley, Teknoman 117, Bryce Schroeder
*Real Solar System Expanded Team for creating Ceres and Vesta that are included

INSTALLATION:
Extract to KSP/GameData. You should have one dll (Module Manager) in the root of GameData, and three new folders: HalfRSS, Kopernicus, and ModuleFlightIntegrator. However, you are NOT DONE YET.

TEXTURE INSTALLATION
Now, you must select a texture resolution. Download a pre-made pack (8192, 4096, or 2048) and then, if desired, selectively replace with different-resolution texutres. Note that 8192 is dangerous: you will almost assuredly run out of memory on 32-bit versions of the game.

You can get the textures from: https://github.com/Pap1723/HalfRSS-Textures
Go to the releases page and grab one of the resolution packs, then (optionally) get replacements from the repo itself.
The path of the folder will be KSP/GameData/RSS-Textures
Make sure you download from here and not the other RSS versions. There are additional biomes as well as additional planets that are included with the HalfRSS version.

RECOMMENDED MODS:
* Custom Asteroids by Starstrider42 - http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72785-11x-custom-asteroids-131-may-7/
This list is going to grow tremendously!


FUTURE PLANS:
* Create RemoteTech Configs (this is done, just not ready for initial release)
* Configs for Antenna Range
* Configs for Kerbalism
* New ScienceDefs for the new planets and moons
* Heightmaps for all of Saturn's moons
* New Biomes for all of Saturn's moons
