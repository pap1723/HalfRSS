This mod will convert the Kerbols System into our Real Solar System, but at half of the actual size. This makes it 5 times larger than KSP stock sizes.

INSTALLATION:
Extract to KSP/GameData. You should have one dll (Module Manager) in the root of GameData, and two folders: Kopernicus and RealSolarSystem. However, you are NOT DONE YET.

TEXTURE INSTALLATION
Now, you must select a texture resolution. Download a premade pack (8192, 4096, or 2048) and then, if desired, selectively replace with different-resolution texutres. Note that 8192 is dangerous: you will almost assuredly run out of memory on 32-bit versinos of the game.

You can get the textures from: https://github.com/Pap1723/HalfRSS-Textures
Go to the releases page and grab one of the resolution packs, then (optionally) get replacements from the repo itself).
The path of the folder will be KSP/GameData/RSS-Textures
Make sure you download from here and not the RSS versions. There are additional biomes as well as additional planets that are included with the HalfRSS version.
